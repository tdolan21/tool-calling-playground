# Tool Calling Playground

This repo has information for ollama, vllm and lorax. This will be updated in the future, but mostly serves as a place for tools that are useful to have, but not substantial enough for a complete release. Notebooks containing different use cases of tool calling for LLMs are greatly appreciated. 

Ultimately, the goal of this repository is to have a full featured web application with access to many open source tools. Until then, I figured that I would start by creating a place to store these tools and make them usable for everyone. 

## Install 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tdolan21/tool-calling-playground
cd playgrounds/
```
To install, look at each specific playground. 

+ vLLM is a large install, we recommend following their [docs](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html) 
+ Ollama is available to install [here](https://ollama.com/)
+ LoRAX is available as a [docker container](https://loraexchange.ai/)
